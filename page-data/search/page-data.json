This way the SDTM annotations are displayed at the proper location, without the need to move boxes of annotations around inside and on top of CRF elements. Even if this takes some space from the CRF Forms width, please notice that the [acrf](/examples/acrf.pdf) is a documentation of the SDTM annotations, while the [bcrf](/examples/bcrf.pdf) is the documentation of the CRF pages themselves. This split also allows space for more rich SDTM annotations.\n\n![Example CRF rendition from pure ODM-xml](images/CRF.png)\n\nThe CRF rendition consists of one table for each Form in the CRF, identified as **FormDef** tags, having the columns below.\n1. A sequence number constructed from the **@OrderNumber** attributes of **ItemGroupRef** and **ItemRef** tags in the ODM-xml file. The number serves as a human reference when discussing and reviewing CRF content, as well as keeping track of the sorting of CRF elements.

Each sentence separated by `'. '` (period blank) in the SDTM annotation is presented on a line of its own for readability. SDTM dataset names are extracted from either **ItemGroupDef/@Domain** or **ItemDef/@SDSVarName** attributes, where the latter may be a two-level name separated by a period `dataset.variable`\n\n## Design choices <a name=\"Design_choices\"/>\nAll vendor specific name spaces and XML addendums to the ODM-XML file are ignored.\n\nThe following assumptions regarding the specifics of the ODM-XML files XPATH are used:\nCRF Element             | XPath                                                          | Comment\n---                     | ---                                                            | ---\nForm Title/Name         | FormDef/Description/TranslatedText                             | As it appears on the CRF\nSection Title/Name      | Sections/ItemGroup/@Name                                       | Never displayed\nQuestion Text           | ItemDef/Question/TranslatedText                                | As it appears on the CRF\nPrompt                  | ItemDef/Alias[@Context=\"prompt\"]/@Name                         | If present in ODM-XML\nCompletion Instructions | ItemDef/Alias[@Context=\"completionInstructions\"]/@Name         | If present in ODM-XML\nImplementation Notes    | ItemDef/Alias[@Context=\"implementationNotes\"]/@Name            | If present in ODM-XML\nMapping Instructions    | ItemDef/Alias[@Context='mappingInstructions']/@Name            | If present in ODM-XML\nCDASH                   | ItemDef/Alias[@Context=\"CDASH\"]/@Name                          | Optional, controlled by a parameter\nSDTM                    | ItemDef/@SDSVarName <br/> ItemDef/Alias[@Context=\"SDTM\"]/@Name | When @Domain attribute not present, Dataset.Variable syntax is assumed\n\nGreat inspiration, as well as the CRF contents, is taken from the [eCRF portal on the CDISC website](https://www.cdisc.org/kb/ecrf). I have made very few changes of my own to the CRF contents to adapt it to my solution. These do include a cleanup of the SDTM annotations and choices, such as:\n* All text constants are enclosed in quotation marks\n* Consistent use of single quotation marks in the SDTM annotations\n* Addition of a reference number for each CRF Question. This has proved useful when reviewing CRFs\n* Instructions/notes are written using a smaller font and in _italics_\n\n### SDTM Datasets and Variables <a name=\"SDTM_Datasets_and_Variables\"/>\nSome debate has been encountered on how to capture Dataset name and Variable name for SDTM annotations in ODM-XML. Some ODM editing/generating systems use the **ItemGroupDef/@Domain** attribute to hold the Dataset name, some do not. Most seems to agree on **ItemDef/@SDSVarName** for the SDTM Variable name. I have chosen to support both, selecting **ItemGroupDef/@Domain** when present, but really encouraging using 2-level names in **ItemDef/@SDSVarName**.\n\nThe main reason for this is to remove the binding between CRF layout and SDTM annotations, imposed by having the Dataset name in the **@Domain** attribute on **@ItemGroupDef** level, and the Variable name in the **SDSVarName** attribute on **ItemDef** level. While this may seem logical by mimicking the tabular Dataset/Variable structure, it really serves no purpose beyond dictating that CRF Forms must be designed following SDTM dataset structure. Practical experience has shown that complex Forms (e.g. Adverse events) often annotate to different SDTM domains (e.g. AE and SUPPAE) in an alternating way, and thus dictates the change of **@ItemGroupDef** (sections) to change domain, serving only SDTM annotation purposes.\n\nMy [interim] solution is to have **SDSVarName** contain both Dataset name and Variable name separated by a period (e.g. AE.AETERM) in common SQL style. A better and more permanent solution is to advocate that [CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/) moves the **@Domain** attribute to the **ItemDef** level i their ODM-XML specification. This will ensure that the Dataset name is specified at the same level as the Variable name, eliminating the need for the CRF sections to be structured after the SDTM annotations. Although this will call for redundant specification of Dataset names in an ODM file, ODM editing/generating systems ought to be able to populate this from SDTM specifications.\n\n## Parameters <a name=\"Parameters\"/>\nParameters to the `crf_1_3_2.xsl` file are documented in the table below\n\nParameter | Description | Default value | Comment\n---         | ---                                 | ---                        | ---\nparmdisplay | Display mode                        | spec                       | **spec**: CRF specification with implementation notes, SDTM annotations, etc. <br/> **bcrf**: Blank CRF for submission <br/> **acrf**: SDTM annotated CRF for submission <br/> **book**: Complete CRF book with forms repeated by visit\nparmstudy   | Name of study or standard           |                            | Can be derived from ODM file name\nparmversion | Version of the ODM-XML file         |                            | Can be derived from ODM file name\nparmstatus  | Status of the ODM-XML file          |                            | Can be derived from ODM file name\nparmname    | Company name                        | My Company                 | User supplied\nparmlogo    | Company logo file name              |                            | User supplied\nparmlang    | Language of TranslatedText          | All, assuming one language | Future implementation\nparmcdash   | Display CDASH annotation from Alias | 1                          | If present, 0 or 1\n\n## Creating PDF documents <a name=\"Creating_PDF_documents\"/>\nIn all browsers, print the CRF renditions as PDF documents on your disk as either SDTM annotated CRF specification,  complete CRF book, [acrf](/examples/acrf.pdf) or [bcrf](/examples/bcrf.pdf) submission documents, respectively.
